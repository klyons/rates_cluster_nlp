# rates_cluster_nlp

The objective is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can analyze and interpret central bank statements, with the aim of predicting future interest rate changes. The model should be capable of:

Text Extraction: Extracting and preprocessing relevant textual data from central bank statements. This includes tasks such as removing stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization.
Information Retrieval: Identifying key themes and sentiments in the text that could influence interest rate decisions. This could involve techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
Clustering: Grouping statements based on their similarities to identify patterns or trends over time. This could be achieved through clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.
Prediction: Using the derived features from the text to predict future interest rate changes. This could involve supervised learning techniques, and the model should be evaluated based on its predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The ultimate goal is to provide a tool that can aid financial analysts and economists in understanding the potential impact of central bank communications on future interest rate decisions.
