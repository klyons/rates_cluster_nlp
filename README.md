# rates_cluster_nlp

The objective was to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that could analyze and interpret central bank statements, with the aim of predicting future interest rate changes. The model was capable of:

Text Extraction: Extracting and preprocessing relevant textual data from central bank statements. This included tasks such as removing stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization.

Information Retrieval: Identifying key themes and sentiments in the text that could influence interest rate decisions. This involved techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

Clustering: Grouping statements based on their similarities to identify patterns or trends over time. This was achieved through clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.

Prediction: Using the derived features from the text to predict future interest rate changes. This involved supervised learning techniques, and the model was evaluated based on its predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The ultimate goal was to provide a tool that could aid financial analysts and economists in understanding the potential impact of central bank communications on future interest rate decisions.

Process of rates regime detection:
Data Acquisition: We collected a comprehensive dataset of historical interest rates, with a preference for high granularity such as daily data.

Data Preprocessing: Given the sensitivity of clustering algorithms to the scale of data, we normalized the dataset as a necessary preprocessing step.

Feature Engineering: To capture the patterns of interest, we engineered relevant features from the data. This included statistical measures like moving averages.

Clustering Analysis: We applied a suitable clustering algorithm, such as K-means or DBSCAN, to the preprocessed data. The choice of algorithm was guided by the specific characteristics of our dataset.

Cluster Evaluation: The quality of the clusters was evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as the silhouette score. We also employed visualization techniques to better understand the characteristics of the clusters.

Regime Interpretation: Finally, we interpreted the identified clusters as distinct “regimes” in interest rates. The defining characteristics of each regime were determined based on the features of the data points within each cluster.

NLP training based on regime detection: Methodology
Data Collection: Speeches from Fed officials were collected, primarily from the Fed’s official website and public records.

Preprocessing: The text data was cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and other non-informative elements. All text was converted to lowercase for consistency.

Feature Extraction: The cleaned text was transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. Techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings were used.

Labeling: Historical data on rate regimes was used to label the data. For instance, speeches from a period known to be a ‘low rate’ regime were labeled as ‘low rate’.

Model Training: A supervised machine learning model was trained on the labeled data. The model could be a classification model for discrete rate regimes, or a regression model for predicting the actual interest rate.

Evaluation and Optimization: The model’s performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics. The preprocessing, feature extraction, or model parameters were adjusted based on these results.

Prediction: The final model was used to predict the rate regime of new Fed speeches.

**Time Series Analysis for Rate Prediction**
In addition to the NLP and clustering methodologies, we also devoted a notebook to time series analysis for predicting rates. This approach was particularly focused on the application of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.

Data Preparation: We prepared our time series data, ensuring it was stationary and suitable for ARIMA modeling.

Model Selection: We applied ARIMA models for our time series analysis. These models are particularly suited for data showing trends or cycles, and can be very effective for rate predictions.

Parameter Optimization: To find the optimal parameters for our ARIMA model, we conducted a manual grid search. Despite being computationally intensive, this process allowed us to fine-tune our model for the best performance.

Incorporating Exogenous Variables: Recognizing that rates are influenced by more than just their past values, we incorporated exogenous variables into our model. Specifically, we included commodity prices and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as they are known to impact interest rates.

Through this comprehensive approach, we were able to develop a robust time series model that could effectively predict future rates. This added another dimension to our toolkit for analyzing and interpreting central bank communications and their impact on future interest rate decisions.
